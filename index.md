Section A02 with Rajesh Gupta

1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

The most interesting topic we covered this quarter was FPGAs and how configuring their electrical pathways enables custom hardware implementations.

2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

A potential investigation we would like to pursue for our Quarter 2 Project would be implementing the LMUL algorithm in actual hardware. For now, we are limited to simulations of implementing the algorith in hardware, which comes with some cons and is comparable to a typical software implementation. However, we may explore the initial steps of configuring an FPGA or ASIC chip. 

3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

A potential change we will make to our current Quarter 1 Project approach may be evaluating speed efficiency of our algorithm in terms of cycles through manual calculations, instead of how many nanoseconds the simulation takes to complete the calculations compared to Python implementations.


4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

We are interested in exploring how to implement LMUL in a variety of more complex machine learning models. We've started with MLPs, but want to expand to NNs, Transformers, and LSTMs.
